## Masterting AWS SAM
Yesterday I started watching [Mastering the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) - AWS Online Tech Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBBewrKR1qg).

I beleive it is a good training to write along the shown templates by hand. Which is why I am taking my time with this MasterClass.

Some highlights:

1. SAM Globals can be used to reuse template code.
2. Building reusable templates through leveraging
    1. Parameters
    2. Pseudo Parameters
    3. Intrinsic functions
3. SAM CLI is for local development, debugging, testing, deploying, and monitoring of serverless applications. Commands covered:
    1. sam init (Creates a new serverless application)
    2. sam build (Generates deployment artifacts targeting Lambda's execution environment)
    3. sam package (Packages a SAM application, by copying the artifacts to an S3 bucket, is a part of deploy, but can be called separately)
    4. sam deploy (Deploys or updates serverless application on AWS Cloud, packages, sand saves deploy options to a config file, has a --guided mode)
