## Create an S3 bucket in a stack using CloudFormation CDK
I followed this tutorial: [Getting Started with AWS CDK and Python | Step by Step Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2cXlYYoQqQ)

Which let me create a CloudFormation stack containing an S3 bucket usin Python. Then destroy that stack.

That simple example let me familiarize even better with the CDK. Doing stuff without a premade code. AKA from scratch.

## Create a simple API
I followed this tutorial: [AWS API Gateway to Lambda Tutorial in Python | Build a HTTP API (2/2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M91vXdjve7A)

Which let me create a simple API covering:
- API Gateway (1 GET and 1 POST urls)
- Lambda Function (A Python function that handles both the GET and POST requests)
- CloudWatch (to observe logs)

Useful notes:
- Print the `event` object inside the lambda function
- Open the log groups page from cloudwatch
- Observe the `event` object containing the request's properties and to access. Which helps in knowing how to parse that `event` object inside the lambda.
