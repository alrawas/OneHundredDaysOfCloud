# AWS App Runner Explained - Overview and Console Walkthrough

## Why App Runner?
Because infrastructure is hard.

Load Balancing, Target Groups, Autoscaling Groups, Security Groups, Domains, Certificates, Monitors, Logging

## What is App Runner?
- Fully Managed Container Deployment Service - Fargate 2.0?
- AutoBuild & Deploy, Load Balancing, Autoscaling, Certificate Setup.
- Log & Metric Integration with AWS Cloudwatch
- Comparable to Heroku for AWS, or ElasticBeanstalk for EC2. But for Fargate.

## Integration & Configuration
- ECR Image Upload, or Github Source Update
- Specify vCPUs (1-2) and Memory (2GB to 4GB)

## Workflow
Connect to your source (ECR or Git) --> Configure your service --> Launch and go

## Pricing Model
- Provisioned Instances - $0.007/GB hour
- Active Instances - $0.064/vCPU hour + $0.007/GB hour
- Basically, more compute and memory, more \$\$
- Additional Charges:
    - Automatic Deployments - 1$/month per application
    - Build Fees - $0.005/build minute
    - Cloudwatch - $0.50 per GB

## Gotchas
- VPC Connectivity is not yet supported (but coming!) may 20,2021
- Can't scale down to zero
