## Masterting AWS SAM
Today I covered what's left of [Mastering the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) - AWS Online Tech Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBBewrKR1qg).

I beleive it is a good training to write along the shown templates by hand. Which is why I am taking my time with this MasterClass.

Some highlights:

SAM CLI is for local development, debugging, testing, deploying, and monitoring of serverless applications. Commands covered:

1. sam local (Provides local development tools for serverless applications)
    1. sam local generate-event
    2. sam local start-api
    3. sam local start-lambda
    4. sam local invoke
2. sam logs
3. debugging locally with SAM CLI in VSCode (simple as preparing a config file, specifying a debug port and attaching to it)

3. Create a lambda function, use boto3 library to execute sql statements against the db.
