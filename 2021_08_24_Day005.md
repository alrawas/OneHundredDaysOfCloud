## Connect to an RDS from local machine's db client
Today I continued my unsupervised learning by following this [AWS RDS MySQL Database Setup | Step by Step Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng_zi11N4_c)

I did this several years before. I needed the refresher.

Did not do much else since I got occupied with some personal matters.

I implemented what's in that tutorial with a tiny twist. As I prefer to use **DBeaver** as a database client.
