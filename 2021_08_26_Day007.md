## Examine The Architecture Of A Real World Architecture (Asynchronous Online Gaming)
This part was a case study I watched today about [Gaming architecture on AWS - Real Life AWS Architecture Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-0yzA3WgXc)

The playlist I am following currently is this one: [AWS Videos to Watch for Backend Developers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9nWRykSBSFhWuF7OOU4NYvVwlawbKaEO)

A takeaway is that these diagrams should not be scary and are not complicated

## Create an Audit Table in AWS
This one was a full blown from A to Z architecture that covered:

- DynamoDb (NoSQL database)
- IAM Roles (with custom policies)
- Lambda (that gets triggered by DynamoDb then sends data to our Kinesis Firehose)
- Kinesis Firehose (that takes data from lambda and sends them organized in batches to S3)
- AWS Glue (can configure a crawler that reads from the S3 folder and transform it to a table)
- Athena (that let us query that table using SQL)

The flow:
1. Add/modify an item in DynamoDb
2. DynamoDb triggers the Lambda through its Stream
3. Lambda
    1. Triggered by DynamoDb Stream
    2. Produce the audit object from the recived Steam.
    3. Send that object to Kinesis Firehose
4. Kinesis Firehose takes that audit object and stores it in batches to an S3 folder of our choice
5. AWS Glue crawls that folder and transform the data to a table
6. Athena reads that table and let us do SQL queries on the audit data


### Useful notes:
- Having an audit table is important to trace the state of objects you want to audit. Which helps in debugging eventually
- This didn't work from the first try so I had to consult **CloudWatch** to fix some mistakes I made in the lambda function

### Reference Lambda Code
```python
import json
import boto3

firehose_client = boto3.client('firehose')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    resultString = ""
    for record in event['Records']:
        parsedRecord = parseRawRecord(record['dynamodb'])
        resultString = resultString + json.dumps(parsedRecord) + "\n"
    print(resultString)
    response = firehose_client.put_record(
        DeliveryStreamName="ChangeMe!!!",
        Record={
            'Data': resultString
        }
    )

def parseRawRecord(record):
    result = {}
    result["orderId"] = record['NewImage']['orderId']['S']
    result["state"] = record['NewImage']['state']['S']
    result['lastUpdatedDate'] = record['NewImage']['lastUpdatedDate']['N']
    return result
 ```
