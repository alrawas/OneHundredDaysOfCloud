This is day 2 / 100 of my 100DaysOfCloud.

It's a Saturday, but I got some little time to not break the days chain.

## Masterting AWS SAM
Yesterday I applied an AWS Sam tutorial with a premade code.

Today I dug deeper and started watching, and taking notes on [Mastering the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) - AWS Online Tech Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBBewrKR1qg).

It's a 45minutes AWS Online Tech Talk. Watching the first 10 minutes got me writing a 751words note file. It's very information packed.

Some highlights:

1. AWS SAM comes in two parts (templates and CLI).
2. The tamplates allow for shorthand syntax for serverless applications.
3. The templates are transformed to CloudFormation templates eventually ( a 20 lines SAM Template can be equivalent to a 193 lines of CloudFormation Template).
4. There are currently 7 serverless resource types available.
5. We can use CloudFormation resources in the same template if needed.
