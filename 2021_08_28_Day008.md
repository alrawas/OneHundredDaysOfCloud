# RDS vs Aurora vs DynamoDB

## RDS - Relational Database Service

It simplifies using databases by handling provisioning, setup, backup, patching, storage, auto-scaling, and more.

Instead of having to manage everything in case of hosting a database inside an EC2 instance.

It offers many database engines such as: MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, Oracle, and MariaDB.

## Aurora

Aurora is a database engine optimized for the cloud.

It is compatible with MySQL and Postges ( user can specify the dialect ).

Some of its features: high availability, **can be serverless**, automatic back-ups with no performace impact, and most importantly separation of storage from compute.

## DynamoDB
Fully managed NoSQL database engine, optimized for key-value lookups.

Recently supports transactions ( all succeed or all fail )

## When to use what ( Aurora vs DynamoDB )
### Aurora:
- RDS Aurora - Start with your Data Relationships
- When you want to keep the door open for flexible access patterns
- When you want to perform bulky, relational queries
- When you want to enforce schema constrains
- When you want to use a ubiquitous access language (SQL)


### DynamoDB:
- DynamoDB - Start with your Access Patterns
- When you have Predictable Access Patterns
- When your search key is known in advance ( give my all the values that have this key AND have this data range )
- When you are willing to sacrifice flexibility for ultra fast and consistent performance
